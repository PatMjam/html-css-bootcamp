    <h1>Mercedes Benz</h1>
    <section>
        <p>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first petrol-powered car, the Benz
            Patent Motorwagen, financed by Bertha Benz[7] and patented in January 1886,[8] and Gottlieb Daimler
            and engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach by the addition of a petrol engine later
            that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft
            (Daimler Motors Corporation). </p>

    <h2>Peugeot</h2>
    <section>
        <p>The Peugeot family of Valentigney, Montbéliard, Franche-Comté, France, began in the manufacturing business in
            the 19th century. In 1842, they added production of coffee, pepper, and salt grinders.[15] The company's
            entry into the vehicle market was by means of crinoline dresses, which used steel rods, leading to umbrella
            frames, saw blades, chisels, wire wheels, and bicycles.[16] Armand Peugeot introduced his
            "Le Grand Bi" penny-farthing in 1882, along with a range of other bicycles. The company's logo, initially a
            lion walking on an arrow, symbolized the speed, strength and flexibility of the Peugeot saw blades.[17]
            The car company and bike company parted ways in 1926 but Peugeot bicycles continued to be built
            until very recently. </p>
