        <p>Toyota is headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi.[11] The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a four-story
            building in Toyota. As of 2006, the head office has the "Toyopet" Toyota logo and the words "Toyota Motor".
            The Toyota Technical Center, a 14-story building, and the Honsha plant, Toyota's second plant engaging in
            mass production and formerly named the Koromo plant, are adjacent to one another in a location near the
            headquarters. Vinod Jacob from The Hindu described the main headquarters building as "modest".[12] In 2013,
            company head Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters
            due to the lack of amenities in the city.</p>

        <p>Volkswagen was established in 1937 by the German Labor Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront) in Berlin.[6]
            In the early 1930s cars were a luxury: most Germans could afford nothing more elaborate than a motorcycle.
            Only one German out of 50 owned a car. Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began
            independent "people's car" projects â€“ the Mercedes 170H, Adler AutoBahn, Steyr 55, and Hanomag 1.3L,
            among others. </p>
