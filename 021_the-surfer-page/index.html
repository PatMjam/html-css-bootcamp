    <p>Hawaiian surfing has a rich tradition. The ancient Hawaiian inhabitants looked as surfing as an integral part of
        life. It was not just a hobby or a job. It was a way of life and an art form for them.</p>

    <p>Constructing a surfboard was a spiritual process, and great care went into all things related to surfing.
        The people were fascinated with the concept of taming the ocean and discovering the mysteries buried beneath the
        powerful waves.</p>

    <p>The most skilled surfers gained prestige and respect in society. Eventually many upper class Hawaiians created a
        society that revolved around the sport.</p>
