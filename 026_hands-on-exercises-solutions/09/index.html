<p>In the late summer of that year we lived in a house
    in a village that looked across the river and the plain to
    the mountains. In the bed of the river there were peb-
    bles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the
    water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the
    channels. Troops went by the house and down the road
    and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the
    trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the
    leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops march-
    ing along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred
    by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and
    afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.
